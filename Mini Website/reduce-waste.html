           <h2>The Reason why we need to reduce food waste</h2>
           <p>Reducing food waste is crucial since it simultaneously addresses a number of personal and societal challenges.  When food is wasted, we are not only discarding the product but also the labor, energy, land, water, and other precious resources that were utilized to generate it.  In order to combat hunger and food insecurity, we can reduce waste in our homes, stretch our finances, and ensure that more food is available for those who actually need it.  More broadly, cutting down on food waste contributes to environmental protection by reducing the quantity of garbage that ends up in landfills, which release methane gas, a primary cause of climate change.</p>
