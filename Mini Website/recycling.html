    <h1>Recycling</h1>
    <p>Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and objects. It helps to reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, decrease energy usage, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and minimize pollution. Here are some key points about recycling:</p>

    <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
    <p>Recycling is crucial because it reduces pollution, waste, and the need for natural resources.  We can reuse items like paper, plastics, and metals through recycling, which lessens the demand for fresh resource extraction or mining.  This reduces the environmental damage brought on by the production of new goods in addition to saving energy.  Recycling also reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, which lowers the possibility of soil, water, and air contamination.  Recycling eventually promotes a circular economy that is more sustainable by reusing resources instead of throwing them away.</p>
