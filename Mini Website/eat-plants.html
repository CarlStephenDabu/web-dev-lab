  <h2>Here, why is important to eat more plants.</h2>
  <ul>
    <h3>For your Health</h3>
    <li>Nutrients and Fiber: Vitamins, minerals, and fiber found in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains help with digestion, reduce cholesterol, and maintain a healthy body.</li>
    <li>Disease Prevention: Diets high in plants lower the risk of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and some types of cancer.</li>
    <li>Weight & Energy: Plant-based diets are typically lower in calories and bad fats, which can help you manage your weight and provide you with consistent energy.</li>

    <h3>For the Environment</h3>
    <li>Reduced Carbon Footprint: Compared to rearing animals, growing plants requires less energy, water, and land.</li>
    <li>Biodiversity: Eating more plant-based foods helps protect ecosystems and lessens deforestation.</li>
    <li>Sustainability: It promotes a food system that uses fewer resources to feed more people.</li>

    <h3>For Society</h3>
    <li>Food Security: Increasing the production of plant-based foods can aid in the global fight against hunger.</li>
    <li>Ethical Considerations: Selecting plants lessens dependency on factory farming and the moral dilemmas associated with the suffering of animals.</li>
